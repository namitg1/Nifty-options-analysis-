Steps for running the notebook- 
1. Rename the dataset as nifty_data.csv. 
2. Run the notebook cell by cell. 
3. Outputs- equity curve, total pnl, daily sharpes for the strategy  
Next steps- the alpha is a dummy alpha based on intuition. To test the correctness of this 
alpha, we need more data. Next steps could be to test my original live alphas. I can calculate 
pcr using OI of all strikes and using my alpha on pcr, spot based alphas . if you feel the 
intuition was correct and the framework build to calculate is right, we can test other alphas 
as well.
